> Remember how long you have been putting this off, how many times you have been given a period of grace by the gods and not used it. It is high time now that you understand the universe of which you are a part, and the governor of that universe of whom you constitute an emanation: and that there is a limit circumscribed to your time - if you do not use it to clear away your clouds, it will be gone, and you will be gone, and the opportunity will not return.   
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

This is one of my favourite passages from Marcus Aurelius, one about procrastination. We often live our life without thinking that we only have a limited time in this world. We live as if we are certain that there will always be a tomorrow to do the things we want to do, say the things we want to say so we tend to put things off to a later time. But in reality, the only certainty is that we are all nearing our end. Realizing this should not make us sad or depressed. With this realization, we must live each minute of everyday fully, without wasting any time. Put an end to procrastination because a virtuous and productive life is a life well lived. Think of this everyday. That this day may be your last, so if it is your last day to do each deed, do it all with your best effort.
