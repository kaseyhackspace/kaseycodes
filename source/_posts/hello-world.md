title: Hello World
---
**Hello World!** If you've done any programming, this sentence is all too familliar to you :). I'm Kasey, and this is the latest of my attempts to start a blog. I started a few along the years, but I keep on forgetting to add to it after the first post. Hopefully this time around, it takes a different turn and I end up posting regularly!

## What will this blog be about?

Well, this blog is going to be about a _LOT_ of stuff! I am thinking mainly about _Computer Science_ topics, but I'll also do posts about life, health, travel, and a lot of meaningful stuff! I'll be spending quality time writing these blogs to hopefully provide good insight to my readers :)
