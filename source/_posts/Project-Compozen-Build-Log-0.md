I've always been a `Python` guy and I've been putting off learning `Node.js` for so long, and I didn't even know the fundamentals of `Node.js`. Part of the reason was I couldn't get it off my head that `javascript` was primarily used for client side browser scripting. But the thing is, `Node.js` enabled `javascript` to run on the server-side. But what really reeled me in is the `Node.js` was built using Chrome's V8 Javascript engine, which makes it really, really, fast. I love fast programs, and if you've known me in college, I was obsessed with making my programs fast and efficient. Hence my love for `C`, `C++`, assembly languages, parallel, distributed and GPU computing :)

My first opensource project in `Node.js` will be `Compozen`! What is `Compozen`? `Compozen` will be a CLI tool for generating and managing `docker-compose` YAML files! These files are used by `docker-compose` a tool used `Docker` to spin up of micro-services that work together in order to make modern applications using Docker work. 

Why do I want to create `Compozen`? Well, I want to introduce it to the Continous Integration and Continous Delivery pipeline I'm building for the awesome clients I work for and I want to use it for my future projects. Hopefully, you guys can use it too when the time comes for you to build your own awesome ideas {% github_emoji grin %}

Here's the repository for it : https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/compozen

I'll keep you guys updated about `Compozen` using these Build Logs reguarly to keep myself in check.
