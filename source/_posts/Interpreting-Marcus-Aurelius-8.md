> Failure to read what is happening in another's soul is not easily seen as a cause of unhappiness: but those who fail to attend to the motions of their own soul are necessarily unhappy.
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

In this passage Marcus contemplates on what makes one person unhappy. He states that those who are unhappy are those to fail to follow the motions of their own soul. It is not the failure of understanding what other people are thinking that makes us generally unhappy. On the contrary, we should care less of what other people think of us. What we need to be sure of doing in order to experience fulfillment is to try our utmost best to be virtuous in everyday life. In doing so, we are attending to the true motions of our own soul.
