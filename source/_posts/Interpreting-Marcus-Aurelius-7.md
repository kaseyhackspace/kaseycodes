> Do externals tend to distract you? Then give yourself the space to learn some further good lesson, and stop your wandering. That done, you must guard against the other sort of drift. Those who are dead to life and have no aim for the direction of every impulse and, more widely, every thought are drivellers in deed as well as word. 
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

This passage was a particularly hard one for me to understand. But in my best attempt, Marcus is again talking about how to better focus on current tasks. He urges us to find a certain space that would free us from external distractions. In that calm space we can further our studies and try our best to stop wandering, and focus on the task at hand. We must also guard against our minds drifting off to mindless thoughts that do us no good, but rather, just can consume our time and lessen our productivity.
