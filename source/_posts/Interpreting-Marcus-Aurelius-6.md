> Self-harm, my soul,  you are doing self-harm: and you will have no more opportunity for self-respect.  Life for each of us is a mere moment, and this life of yours is nearly over, while you still show yourself no honour, but let your own welfare depend on other people's souls.
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

We see a very powerful message from Marcus Aurelius about self worth. It seems that we ourselves have always looked for and longed for the approval of others in everything that we do. The problem is that when we do this, we are just doing ourselves self-harm. For it does not depend on others how much worth we have, that depends entirely on how virtously we live our lives. Everyone life is just a mere moment compared to the existence of our universe. So why hurt yourself and waste your time finding the approval of others, longing for their applauses or in our age likes, hearts and shares. Use this brief moment to make yourself matter virtously, and you will find true happiness in the form of contentment of having lived a good life (Eudaimonia).
