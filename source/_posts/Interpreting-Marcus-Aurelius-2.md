> Whatever it is, this being of mine is made up of flesh, breath, and directing mind. Now the flesh you should disdain - blood, bones, a mere fabric and network of nerves, veins, and arteries. Consider too what breath is: wind - and not even a constant, but all the time being disgorged and sucked in again. That leaves the third part, the directing mind. Quit your books - no more hankering: this is not your gift. No, think like this, as if you were on the point of death: "you are old; don't then let this directing mind of yours be enslaved any longer - no more jerking to the strings of selfish impulse, no more disquiet at your present or suspicion of your future fate."
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

Marcus Aurelius in this passage contemplates what elements we are composed of and how important each one is. He divides these elements into three distinctions. The first is our body, which he states is just a network of nerves, veins and arteries covered by skin (fabric in his words). Next is our breath, which he states is not a permanent part of us, since we continually breathe it. With each breath we convert oxygen to carbon dioxide, so this is very true as each breath is different than the last. The last, and most importantly is the directing mind that governs us. Rather than simplifying the mind physically as he did with the body and the breath, Marcus says "Quit your books - no more hankering: this is not your gift." This shows that he puts the directing mind of utmost importance in our very being. What is also very interesting is that Marcus urges us to stop overthinking when he says "Quit your books" and "no more disquiet at your present or suspicion of your future fate." Too much overthinking can paralyse us, wasting the limited time we have in this life. In contrast, Marcus also tells us to be more calculating, by telling us to stop "jerking to the strings of self impulse." To react based on impulse is of the body which is ever fleating, and not of the all important directing mind.
