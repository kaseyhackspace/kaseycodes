Last week we conducted a basic C Programming workshop at Saint Louis University, Baguio! It was a cool experience, and I really wanted to make sure that the students really understood the concepts we taught. After the session, we promised them that we would upload all the demo code we made for them to study and practise on :)

Here's the main repository:
https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo

If you don't know how to use `git` and github.com, don't worry, I'll make a post about that one of these days when I get the time!

In the meantime, here are links per chapter/topic so that you guys don't have to learn git right away :). Once you are redirected to the branch, go ahead and click on `main.c` in order to view the source code for that topic.

1.  [Command line arguments](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/1_cmd_line_arguments)
2. [Input Output](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/2_input_output)
3. [Arithmetic and Conditional Operators](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/3_operators)
4. [Conditional Statements](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/4_conditional)
5. [The Switch Statement](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/5_switch)
6. [Loops](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/6_loops)
7. [Functions](https://github.com/kaseyhackspace/c_demo/tree/7_functions)

There you have it, all the source code for last week's C programming workshop! Stay tuned as I'll be discussing each source code in detail in the days to come :)
