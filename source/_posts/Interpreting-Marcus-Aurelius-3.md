> The works of the gods are full of providence. The works of Fortune are not independent of Nature or the spinning and weaving together of the threads governed by Providence. All things flow from that world: and further factors are necessity and the benefit of the whole universe, of which you are a part. Now every part of nature benefits from that which is brought by the nature of the Whole and all which preserves that nature: and the order of the universe is preserved equally by the changes in the elements and the changes in their compounds. Let this be enough for you, and your constant doctrine. And give up your thirst for books, so you do not die a grouch, but in true grace and heartfelt gratitude of the gods.
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

In this passage we see Marcus look at things from a high level view. In this view, he notes that all the things that happen to us are part of our fate, as we are all connected by the divine Providence of the gods for the benefit of the whole universe. We are but fragments, each with his/her own part to play for the preservation and benefit of Nature. For in this constant collaboration and balance, the universe is preserved and order is achieved. 

Being part of one same Nature, we must always remember that each of us has a duty to fulfill in order to preserve and bring order to the universe. No person is too small, as each one has a role to play. Knowing this, we must work in accordance to preserve Nature. Take note that all of us benefit from Nature and in working against Nature we only bring harm not only to ourselves, but to the universe as a whole. Keep this in mind and in action every day, in everything that you do. 

Marcus also gets a bit scientific with how the universe is preserved with each change in the elements and their compounds, and states that knowing this is enough for us, to form our constant doctrine. He urges us to control our thirst of books to avoid dying a grouch. He states than the fundamentals are enough to guide us and good enough for us to act accordingly to our duty. Similar to his passage before this one, he notes that we need not take in too much knowledge, and we should be content with the fundamentals that we already know. This is very helpful whenever we have a problem at hand and try to over-complicate the solution. The simplest solution is often the best one.
