> The works of the gods are full of providence. The works of fortune are not independent of Nature or the spinning and weaving together of the threads govered by Providence. All things flow from that world: and further factors are necessity and the benefit of the whole universe, of which you are a part. Now every part of nature benefits from that which is brought by the nature of the Whole and all which preserves that nature: and the order of the universe is preserved equally by the changes in the elements and the changes in their compounds. Let this be enough for you, and your constant doctrine. And give up your thirst for books, so you do not die a grouch, but in true grace and heartfelt gratitude of the gods.
