> Every hour of the day give vigorous attention, as a Roman and as a man, to the performance of the task in hand with precise analysis, with unaffected dignity, with human sympathy, with dispassionate justice - and to vacating your mind from all its other thoughts. And you will achieve this vacation if you perform each action as if it where the last of your life: freed, that is, from lack of aim, from all passion-led deviation from the ordinance of reason, from pretence from love of self, from dissatisfacyion with what fate has dealt you. You see how few things a man needs to master for the settled flow of a god fearing life. The gods themselves ask nothing more of one who keeps these observances. 
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

Today's passage is all about how to be more productive. Marcus advises us that in order to be more productive, we must do each task with intense focus. When we concentrate on the task at hand, vacating our mind from dwelling into unrelated issues,  we will be able to use the fullest of our potential on solving that task. This is so true for me, as I always struggle to finish my tasks whenever I try my best at multi-tasking. With multi-tasking, we are always putting our mind on reset whenever we switch from one task to another. 

One more powerful advice Marcus gives us is to do each task as if it were the last of our life. Time is always fleeting, and each second we get closer into turning back into oblivion. Therefore precious time should not be wasted, as each second spent idly is another second lost. We should remember that it is against our nature to be idle, as we not only hinder the progress of ourselves but we also hinder the balance of nature by neglecting to use our time more wisely.
