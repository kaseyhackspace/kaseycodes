> Say to yourself the first thing in the morning: today I shall meet people who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous, malicious, unsocial. All this has afflicted them through their ignorance of true good and evil. But I have seen that the nature of good is what is right, and the nature of evil is what is wrong; and I have reflected that the nature of the offender himself is akin to my own - not a kinship of blood or seed, but a sharing in the same mind, the same fragment of divinity. Therefore I cannot be harmed by any of them, as none will infect me with their wrong. Nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him. We were born for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like rows of upper and lower teeth. So to work in opposition to one another is against nature: and anger or rejection is opposition.
> -- <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite>

In our day to day lives, it is not uncommon to encounter people who are very meddling, ungrateful, aggresive, treacherous, malicious, unsocial, or any other trait that we consider bad. The important thing to note is that we must realize that there are things that we cannot control, and things that we can control. This is referred to in traditional stoicism as the Dichotomy of Control. How other people act towards us is something that is not in our control. What is in our total control is how we react to these types of people. Rather than showing anger, Marcus Aurelius tells us to prepare ourselves each day by accepting that we know what is right from wrong, and what is good from evil. We are aware of such and they are not, so we should not act rashly in anger and retaliate. We are of the same nature and fragment of divinity, so acting in opposition to them is against that very nature. Allowing yourself each day to remember this will give you a certain script of how to deal with wrongdoers, if ever you may encounter them each day.
