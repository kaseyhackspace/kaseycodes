Hi, I'm Kasey! I'm a lot of things, and right now, I might be exactly what you need.

### A Computer Scientist
With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of the Philippines Baguio and a Masters of Information Systems from the University of the Philippines Open University, I am committed to creating only the most efficient solutions. A lot of my skills have been honed in parallel with what the University teaches. I believe that even though fundamentals are important, you owe it to yourself to grow and continually learn beyond what is being taught. So if you're a computer science student, or in any other course that has programming in it, then I'd love for you to read my content!

### A Maker
What is a maker? Well, a maker is an individual who loves to tinker to understand how things work. From that understanding, a maker will then try to "Do It Yourself" to replicate, innovate and improve on a particular device. From my background as a computer scientist and a computer technician(I've been building desktop computers since I was in grade school), I have the skills in order to understand how devices fundamentally work and create my own little projects from them!

### A GIS Specialist
GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. These are information systems that help you create, manage and process spatial data. After a few months as a remote backend developer when I just graduated from my Computer Science degree, a professor of mine who I worked for as an Android Developer/Student Assistent called me to serve the country as a Science Research Specialist for the Phil-LiDAR 1 project. It was a Department of Science and Technology(DOST) funded project where we created high resolution flood hazard maps to give local government units. The maps gave them a more updated and accurate way of disaster risk reduction and management during typhoons. 

What particularly did I do? Well, to name a few, I was the system administrator for the laboratory infrastructure, handled a lot of process automations, made improvements on the GIS workflows and acted as both a software/hardware architect and  developer for our in house developed weather stations and apps.

### A Drone Pilot
Also during my Phil-LiDAR 1 days, we purchased a DJI Inspire 1 drone, and there were 2 drone pilots! I was one of them, and my co-pilot was my very beautiful, smart, talented girlfriend Eloise <3 I also own my own quadcopter, a tiny but very nimble Hubsan X4!

### An Entrepreneur
After Phil-LiDAR 1, my very beautiful, smart, talented girlfriend Eloise and I established Hackspace Makerspace and Cafe! It is a hybrid between a makerspace and a cafe. At Hackspace you can rent out our electronics modules if you want to learn how to tinker or prototype your next electronics project! We also have 3d printers where you can make physical objects from your 3d models. Last but definitely not the least, we offer lovely delicious food that are cooked to perfection! Try it, I dare you :D
